								<h3>The failure of “keep the critical vote” appeal</h3>
                                <p>The recent Legco by-election polling data suggested that “keep the critical votes” no longer appeal to the voters. But why? How important are the pan-democratic camp votes in the Legco? Did the pan-democratic legislators treasure their votes in past? </p>
								<p>Despite the political storm of disqualifying the Legco by-election candidates in the past few weeks, Hong Kong has just passed one of the quietest election with a low-turnout rate. Candidates of the Pan-democracy camp have been using “keep the critical votes” as an emergency appeal to call for more voters. Yet, they failed to win all of the four seats back, as polling result suggests that there’s a shrink of its vote share. </p>
                                <p>The total turnout rate of the by-election dropped by more than 4 percent against the 2016 by-election and 18.2 percent against the general election. </p>
                                <div class="row">
                                    <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
                                        <br>
                                        <p>Apart from the failure of political campaigns and appeal to the local supporters admitted by the candidates, some voters expressed their disappointment towards the past performance of the pan-democratic legislators by “cast the vote in the sea”, which literally means casting a blank vote.</p>
                                        <p>In three recent by-elections, the blank vote rate reached 3.4 percent in 2010’s controversial “Five Constituency Referendum”, followed by a significant drop to 0.38 percent in 2016, and in this year rose up to 0.92 percent.</p>

                                <p>The attendance of the Pan-democratic camps is vital in keeping the critical vote. As a simple majority vote is needed in order to pass or object the bill, motions or amendments proposed by the government and individual legislators. </p>
                                <h5>Motions, bills or amendments introduced by or to the Government</h5>
                                <p>On one occasion, a simple majority vote of all present legislators is needed to pass the bills introduced by the government. As for the motions or amendments introduced by individual legislators to the government bills, a simple majority vote is needed in both of the functional constituencies and the geographical constituencies groups in the direct elections.</p>
                                <h5>Motions, bills or amendments introduced by individual Members</h5>
                                <p>For the motions, bills or amendments introduced by individual legislators, the voting procedures involved are similar to the method mentioned above. However, the passage of the motions, bills or amendments requires a majority vote from the present legislators from both groups.</p>

                                <p>In the following cases, motions put by Pan-democracy legislators were rejected due to the veto of the Pro-establishment camp in the Functional Constituency. To made the matter worst, movers of these motions did not gain enough support from members of the same camp.</p>

                                <p>Raymond Chan Chi-chuen, from People Power party, told the Citizen News that attendance is the basic requirement and Pan-democratic members should attend different meetings more proactively. </p>

                                        “We said we want to struggle inside the LegCo. But if you don’t attend the meetings at all, how can you fight?”, said Raymond. “It’s not ideal that only several Pan-democratic members present in the meetings, things can happen at anytime. It’s easy to let the Pro-establishment to do whatever they want when we don’t have enough members.”

                                <p>Dennis Kwok Wing-hang, from the Civic Party, said that he’s more focused on the meetings of Bills Committee as he is the representative of the Legal functional constituency, according to Citizen News. He said that he would attend more meetings in the future. </p>
                                <p>SHIU Ka-chun said that his attendance rate was low when he just became the legislator as he thought House Committee and Subcommittees only handle logistic matters. He said that he has already improved his attendance by attending more meetings. </p>

                                        <p>Among the above discussed controversial issues, the failure of passing the follow-up subcommittee on Wang Chau Development Project Bill proposed by pan-democratic legislator Eddie Chu Hoi-dick caused backlashes from the supporters most. It also led to a dispute among the camp members. As ten pan-democratic legislators were absent on that day. </p>
                                        <p>Chu later that day post on his Facebook page that the failure is due to failure of getting a simple majority vote during the direct election session among the geographical constituency. </p>
                                
                                        <p>The Democratic Party member Lam Cheuk-ting responded to Chu that he was waiting to made a confession in the high court on the district council election petition filed by his opponent. He stated that he wished to strengthen mutual communication among the camp members to avoid unnecessary misunderstanding in the future, according to the report by Inmedia Hong Kong.  </p>
                                        <p>Leung Kai-Cheong said he was the convener of the "300 plus" consortium of the democratic election committee and was required to accompany the candidates to sign up on that day. He said that he could not reschedule with others as it was their common strategy to register on the first day.</p>

The program was originally scheduled to end at 9 a.m. but it overran to 9:30 a.m., so she failed to come back and vote.</p>
                                <p>Wan Siu-kin, also from the Democratic Party, claimed that he was  being interviewed by the media and in a meeting with the market hawkers at that time. He claimed that no one called him back to vote. </p>

                                <h3>Voters call for better performances of the Pan-democratic camp</h3>
                                <p>No one can guarantee things will get better if the Pan-democratic camp could perform perfect attendance, but their absence is making the "Critical Vote" claim less persuasive. </p>

                                <p>The high absent rate that led to the failure in fully utilizing the power of the critical vote disappointed the voters. Many hope that they can improve their performances in the future.  </p>

                                        “Election is not about choosing a camp, but choosing the candidate whose manifesto and performance are endorsed by voters”, said Perry.

                                <p>Connie Yeung, 35, a voter of the New Territories East, said that she was reluctant to cast her vote for the Pan-democratic candidate even though she did so in the by-election. </p>

                                        “The blank vote to my mind expresses a growing dissatisfaction with the entire political system. This should worry both sides, as if people lose faith in the constitutionally mandated form of political representation they will take to working outside the system”, said Evan.
